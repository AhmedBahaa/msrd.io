Finally after 15 years, the Regional Directors have a home on the
Internet--we were waiting to see if it was just a passing fad. It's not.

## What you can expect from us
We'll let you know where you can find us. We usually group up at big
industry conferences like Microsoft BUILD or the MVP Summit. 

## How the site will change over time
Each RD will have their own personal "page",
http://msrd.io/scott_stanfield or something like that.
